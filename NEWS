What's new in version 0.2?
--------------------------

Many minor bugs fixed, some new features added:

- Support for multidimensional arrays

- Pointers to struct/union now are not just addresses but objects that
  contain type info

- New functions to read lists

- Pointers to functions are now processed differently from generic pointers
  This is needed on IA64 where they are really Function Descriptors

- Performance improvements in struct/union field access

- Documentation updated


- The companion 'LinuxDump' package now contains a powerful utility
  'xportshow.py' that can print many types of networking information:
  interface info, tunables, NETFILTER, routing, summary, IPv4/6 connections
  for kernels 2.4.20 - 2.6.20
